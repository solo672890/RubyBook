# the life i am looking forward to

I want to be a free spirited person, not worried about money, performance, family and children

I don't have too much desire, including money

But sometimes it can also be very confusing because there is no desire, leading to no goal

Living day after day, year after year, constantly repeating, sometimes unwilling, and sometimes feeling that this kind of life is good

So, I am currently unsure of what kind of life I want or who I want to live with
